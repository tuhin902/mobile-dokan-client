                <p className='text-xl'>Ans:As your application grows, it helps to be more intentional about how your state is organized and how the data flows between your components. Redundant or duplicate state is a common source of bugs. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to structure your state well, how to keep your state update logic maintainable, and how to share state between distant components.With React, you won’t modify the UI from code directly. For example, you won’t write commands like “disable the button”, “enable the button”, “show the success message”, etc. Instead, you will describe the UI you want to see for the different visual states of your component (“initial state”, “typing state”, “success state”), and then trigger the state changes in response to user input. This is similar to how designers think about UI.

                <p className='text-xl'>Prototyping is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms from paper to digital. Teams build prototypes of varying degrees of fidelity to capture design concepts and test on users. With prototypes, you can refine and validate your designs so your brand can release the right products.Prototyping is the fourth phase of both design thinking and design sprints. It’s an essential part of user experience (UX) design that usually comes after ideation, where you/your team have created and selected ideas that can solve users’ needs.

                <h2 className='text-3xl font-semibold mb-5'>Q3- What is a unit test ? Why should we write unit test?</h2>
                <p className='text-xl'>What is Unit Testing? Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness.Unit tests save time and money. Usually, we tend to test the happy path more than the unhappy path. If you release such an app without thorough testing, you would have to keep fixing issues raised by your potential users. The time to fix these issues could’ve been used to build new features or optimize the existing system. Bear in mind that fixing bugs without running tests could also introduce new bugs into the system.

                <p >Ans: There are three frameworks for building web applications that every frontend developer has heard about: React, Vue.js, and Angular. React is a UI library, Angular is a fully-fledged front-end framework, while Vue.js is a progressive framework. They can be used almost interchangeably to build front-end applications, but they’re not 100 percent the same, so it makes sense to compare them and understand their differences. Each framework is component-based and allows the rapid creation of UI features. However, they all have a different structure and architecture — so first, we’ll look into their architectural differences to understand the philosophy behind them.
